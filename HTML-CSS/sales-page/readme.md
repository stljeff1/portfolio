### Sales Page
***

#### Objective

A display for 3 products, and each product has two formats, download and physical. Also, I needed a way to show discounts and adjusted prices. Finally, I needed to be able to change the highlight color of the page easily, so I am including the pre-compiled .styl file, instead of the final CSS.
