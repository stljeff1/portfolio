### Header for Mixitini Matrix
***

#### Objective
The client wanted this wavy, flowy header for the site. I came up with a design (warning, I am not a designer), and implemented the design with HTML and CSS. The design is graphic intensive, but I tried to compromise and slice up the design in a way to limit the file size of the images

*Built using Twitter Bootstrap.
