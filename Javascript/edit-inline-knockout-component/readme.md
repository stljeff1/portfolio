## Inlne Editing with Knockout JS
***

### Date: March, 2017

### Purpose

I  wanted to show form fields only after the user clicked on the data. I decided to use a [custom component](http://www.knockmeout.net/2014/06/knockout-3-2-preview-components.html). This exercise was initially part of a larger project utilizing Bootstrap and Knockout.

The initial "requirements" only pertained to text fields, but I reckon this functionality could be used for any form field.

See my [blog post](http://blog.jeffwilkerson.net/playing-with-knockoutjs-custom-bindings-and-components/) and [codepen](http://codepen.io/stljeff1/pen/mWoOrx) for more on this example.
