#### Countdown using AngularJS
***

### Date: January, 2016

### Purpose

The client wanted to display a countdown on site, and needed the counter to stop at 0 when time ended (ie, not show a negative time).

The solution needed to use jQuery and AngularJS, since those tools were already on the site.

See my [blog post](http://blog.jeffwilkerson.net/countdown-directive/) and [codepen](http://codepen.io/stljeff1/pen/rrjBxg) for more on this example.
