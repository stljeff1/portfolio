#### Countdown using AngularJS

###Date: November, 2016

###Purpose

A project I gave myself to explore how to create an object that will tell me when the user goes idle.

See my [blog post](http://blog.jeffwilkerson.net/idle-timeout-angularjs/) and [codepen](http://codepen.io/stljeff1/pen/BLKWmv) for more on this example.
