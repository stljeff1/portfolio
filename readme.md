# A Sample of Snippets, from Jeff Wilkerson
***

I've spent half my life learning anything I can about web development. I have focused more on the UI/UX side of things, but my grasp of fundemental programming concepts allow me to dabble in server side technologies. To learn more about my skills and abilities, find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrwilkerson), or [view my website](http://jeffwilkerson.net/qualifications.php).

This repository contains snippets from past projects that illustrate my understanding of important web technologies.
